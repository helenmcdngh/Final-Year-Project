#Project Outline 
#### Final Year Project 2017

I have decided to create an application to help secondary level students store their notes. It is a very easy application to use so any student can use it. It uses an MySQL database to store all the data, it will ask the student to log in into the system and they will be allowed to create, modify and delete rows from their database. 

The database has 4 tables and there called subjects, topics, subject_topics, topic_diagrams.
